class Hangman:
    '''
    A Hangman Game that asks the user for a letter and checks if it is in the word.
    It starts with a default number of lives and a random word from the word_list.

    
    Parameters:
    ----------
    word_list: list
        List of words to be used in the game
    num_lives: int
        Number of lives the player has
    
    Attributes:
    ----------
    word: str
        The word to be guessed picked randomly from the word_list
    word_guessed: list
        A list of the letters of the word, with '_' for each letter not yet guessed
        For example, if the word is 'apple', the word_guessed list would be ['_', '_', '_', '_', '_']
        If the player guesses 'a', the list would be ['a', '_', '_', '_', '_']
    num_letters: int
        The number of UNIQUE letters in the word that have not been guessed yet
    num_lives: int
        The number of lives the player has
    list_letters: list
        A list of the letters that have already been tried

    Methods:
    -------
    check_letter(letter)
        Checks if the letter is in the word.
    ask_letter()
        Asks the user for a letter.

    def check_letter(self, letter) -> None:
        '''
        Checks if the letter is in the word.
        If it is, it replaces the '_' in the word_guessed list with the letter.
        If it is not, it reduces the number of lives by 1.

        Parameters:
        ----------
        letter: str
            The letter to be checked

        # TODO 3: If the letter is in the word, the number of UNIQUE letters in the word that have not been guessed yet has to be reduced by 1
        # TODO 3: If the letter is not in the word, reduce the number of lives by 1

        2. If the character is a single character
